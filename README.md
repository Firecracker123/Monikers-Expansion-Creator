# What is this project?
I started this project earlier last year to help a friend of mine make their own expansion to the card party game Monikers. They had a large collection of cards already made in their phone's notes app and I could tell it would be incredibly inefficent to have to make every single card. 

So I made this project that took their large (and incredibly consistantly formated notes) to automate the creation process of this expansion from endless hours to under a minute!

# How this Project works

The project works by entering the card information into the CSV file provided. The formatting is a little unorthodoxed as when my friend made their notes they were not planning for it being machine parsable.

After adding the card info into the CSV run the GenerateCards.py file. After running a "Cards" directory should be created with all your generated card files in them!
